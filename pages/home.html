			Our research focuses on the molecular biology of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear proteins, their role in the virus lifecycle and the pathogenesis of EBV associated malignancies. Herpesviruses infect their hosts for life and EBV precisely manipulates growth and survival signaling pathways of B lymphocytes, resulting in their immortalization. Understanding the mechanisms that EBV has evolved to exploit infected cells is an important basis for therapy of EBV associated diseases and offers a unique vantage from which to view and understand complex cellular pathways.

				EBV expresses four nuclear proteins (EBNA2, EBNA3A, 3B, and 3C) that target a single DNA binding protein in the Notch signaling pathway. This protein, called RBPJ (also CBF1 or CSL), binds to the DNA sequence GTGGGAAA and is normally transcriptionally inactive. In the Notch signaling pathway, the intracellular portion of the Notch (ICN) receptor is released upon ligand binding. ICN travels to the nucleus, binds to RBPJ, displacing any repressors that may be complexed with RBPJ and recruiting the activator protein Mastermind (MM), resulting in transcription of Notch regulated genes. The EBV nuclear protein EBNA2 mimics ICN, binding to RBPJ and upregulating expression of EBV latent genes and many cell genes usually regulated by Notch.

				The EBNA3 proteins are also expressed during latent infection of B cells and bind to RBPJ with a highly conserved domain in their N-termini. The EBNA3 proteins can compete with EBNA2 for RBPJ binding and repress EBNA2 activation of the EBNA (Cp) promoter. Thus, one role for EBNA3 proteins may be to limit “feed forward” upregulation of EBNA2 expression. This shared ability to compete with EBNA2 is unlikely to explain the unique roles of EBNA3A and EBNA3C in promoting lymphocyte growth. Although non-transcriptional activities of the EBNA3 proteins have been proposed to explain this requirement, recent studies from several groups have demonstrated that the ability of EBNA3A and EBNA3C to synergistically repress expression of the p16INK4A tumor suppressor gene is essential for EBV transformation of B lymphocytes.  RBPJ is essential for this activity and EBNA3A and EBNA3C mutants defective for RBPJ interaction fail to suppress p16 and cannot support B lymphocyte growth.  We are interested in defining the mechanisms by which the EBNA3 proteins regulate distinct subsets of cell genes via interactions with the same DNA binding protein, RBPJ.

			EBV replication is controlled by two immediate early tranactivators, Rta and Zta. In a genome wide screen designed to identify all interactions among EBV proteins we discovered that Rta interacted with LF2, an EBV protein of unknown function. LF2 is encoded by one of three genes (LF1, LF2, and LF3) present in wildtype EBV, but deleted from the EBV reference strain, B95-8. We subsequently discovered that LF2 profoundly inhibited Rta’s ability to upregulate EBV replication genes. In cell based assays, LF2 can inhibit EBV DNA replication, lytic protein expression, and production of extracellular viral particles (virions), normally induced by Rta. LF2 homologs are present in all gamma herpesvirsuses sequenced to date and are incorporated into virions of many of this viruses, including the Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). We speculate that LF2 homologs are incorporated gamma herpesvirus particles to prevent replication upon initial infection, just as alpha and beta herpesviruses incorporate transcriptional activators into their virions to promote it.

				EBV normally replicates in the oral epithelium and is shed in the salvia asymptomatically.  In vivo, epithelial differentiation appears to be the key event that activates EBV replication.  We are interested in understanding the epigenetic and transcriptional events linking EBV replication to differentiation.  We are pursuing this goal using a model developed by the Kenney Laboratory in which telomerase immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs) are latently infected with the Akata strain of EBV.  NOKs will undergo differentiation when grown in “raft” cultures, and importantly, this results in activation of EBV replication.  We are using this model to define the epigenetic and gene transcription changes that occur in the cell and EBV genomes during differentiation.  These studies will enrich our understanding of the control of EBV replication in epithelial cells and may help explain why EBV fails to replicate, but instead establishes latent infection, in EBV associated epithelial tumors such as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma.
